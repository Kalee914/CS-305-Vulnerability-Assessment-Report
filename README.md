# CS-305-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report
* Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that offers customized financial plans for individuals. Their plans comprise financial savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial highly values the security of their software, supposed a financial consulting firm needs to obtain and store sensitive and personal data. The data may include personal monetary flows, loans, debt, wills, trusts, etc. Therefore, they want the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They want us to examine  Artemis Financials’ web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities and create a mitigation plan to protect the organization from external threats.

* What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  
I did very well on the mitigation planning. I offered suggestions to fix each of the vulnerabilities that were found in my report. Software security enhances company reliability and trust, keeping employees, clients, and partners safe from data leaking. Therefore, Secure coding is crucial to protect data, avoiding external threats such as hacking, phishing, and identity theft.  

* What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The manual review of the vulnerability assessment was challenging for me. I was unfamiliar with the spring framework, like how securing the spring rest worked However, after help from the professor and research, I learned that after the rest controller class is created, a new @configuration class should be implemented with some authentication to protect the REST endpoints. 
•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I deployed an appropriate algorithm cipher to encrypt and produced a checksum verification to increase the layers of security. I would use a vulnerability assessment process flow diagram to seek security weaknesses and static testing to generate a dependency check report to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation techniques. 
•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I did functional testing by running the refactored code, and it executed without errors. I also verified secure communication by going to https://localhost:8443 in the browser to ensure the software application was secure. Then, I performed another static test to generate a new dependency check report to see if any new vulnerabilities were introduced. 
•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
It is practical to use the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram and OWASP dependency-Check to seek security vulnerabilities. Also, it is a good practice to do testing continuously throughout the development process and verify secure communication, functional testing, and static testing. 
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I will offer to present Projects One and Two from this assignment. Project One is an analysis report which includes an interpretation of client needs, areas of security, manual review, static testing, and a mitigation plan. Project two is implementation; this shows the self-signed certificate was successfully created, the hash function was executed without errors, dependency vulnerabilities were suppressed, and the refactored code was functional. Both projects together show my ability and knowledge to complete vulnerability assessments and code securely.
